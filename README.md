# pyglobalplatform

Swig Python bindings for the GlobalPlatform (https://github.com/kaoh/globalplatform) library.

Not to be confused with https://github.com/JavaCardOS/pyGlobalPlatform , which is widely out of date.

## Requirements

Python 3 with `setuptools`, a C toolchain, `swig`, and `pkg-config` need to be available.

The `pcsclite` and `globalplatform` libraries need to be available via pkg-config.

## Installation

`python setup.py install`
